This problem was generally pretty easy to do when I finally understood what was going on. Looking at the example problem I was trying to find a pattern that occrued frequently until I started looking at every subheap. When looking at each individual subheap, I noticed that the child nodes were the one responsible for inverting the binary tree. Knowing that it was pretty easy to implement. All I did was make sure that the root was not null, and if it was I'd return the root. Then I would just swap the left and right child node and call the right child and left child recursively, then return the root.
