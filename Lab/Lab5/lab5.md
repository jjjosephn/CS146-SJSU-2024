Approaching this lab problem, I was able to visually understand how it all works, but I had trouble implementing the code, until we had discussed in class about upper and lower boundaries. Using the knowledge that I learned in class, I noticed that when we are looking through a bst recursivley we would have minimum and maxinum values. Knowing this, I knew that the root node would be -infinity is less than the root which is less than infinity. Then everytime we would look through the right child node, we would set the minimum as the parent node, and the max as inifnity. Alternatively, everytime we would look through the left child node, we would set the minimum as -infinity, and the max as parent node. If we continue this recursively without any errors, then it would return true. Also before these recursive properties, I would make sure that the current node is greater than the left child, and the current node is less than the right child.
