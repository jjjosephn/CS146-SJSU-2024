The approach I used to find an algorithm for this question is by first conceptualizing how everything all works. In terms of this lab, the best approach was to use a hashmap. I looped through the entire nums(array) and had the total(int) to equal the target minus the current nums content, and if the target isn't found wihtin the hashmap, I would add the key as the nums content and the value as the index of the nums content. It would then continue to loop through the entire nums(array) until it looks into the hashmap and notices that the total value is equal to a key in the hashmap. It would then print out the index of the found key and the current index of the loop.
