On my first couple attempts, I decided to use a hashmap, and iterate through the entire string, setting the key as every unique letter, and the value as the amount of times it is seen in the string. And to make sure that I find the longest palindrome, I divided every key value by 2 and multiplied it by 2 and added it to a result integer. And if the result integer was even and the letter that I was out had 1 extra letter, then I would add an extra 1 to the result and continued to do that for every letter. However, after checking my solution, I was able to find a faster and more efficient way that had the same approach. In this way, instead of using hashmaps, I used an array and a for each loop that counted every unique letter and value through the entire string.
