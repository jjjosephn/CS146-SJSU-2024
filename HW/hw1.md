When trying to solve this homework problem my first thoughts were to have a string with a word in it and another empty string, iterate backwards on the word string and add it to the empty string, then compare both strings to each other. However, I found a much better solution after solivng the homework problem by looking on Google and learning about "pointers." I used two pointers, one at the start of the string, and another pointer at the end of the string. Then I implemented three "tests." First, if one of the pointers is pointing at a character that isn't a number/letter then it'll move to the next character. Second, if the pointers are pointing to a character that aren't equal to each other, then it'll return false. Last, if the pointers are pointing to the same character, it'll conintue incrementing/decrementing until it reaches the half way mark and return true.
