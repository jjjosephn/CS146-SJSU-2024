For this homework problem, I implemented DFS, an algorithm that we had just recently learned in class. My approach for solving was to:
1. grab the current color within the matrix, the max height, and the max width of the matrix
2. Create a new method/function for dfs that contains the parameters sr(row) and sc(col)
3. Make constraints where if any fails (row < 0 or row > max height or col < 0 or col > max width or the current color != matrix color or the current color == new color) it just returns
4. If the constraints are passed, then change the matrix[sr][sc] to the new color
5. Then recursively call the dfs method/function for top, right, bottom, left of the current index
6. Recall dfs(sr,sc) one last time
7. Return the matrix
