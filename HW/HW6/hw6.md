On my first attempt for this problem, I had solved it by brute force using three for loops. I definitely knew this wasn't the best way of solving the problem, so I had to try different methods. I couldn't really figure out any particular method to solving this problem, so I had searched on the web for some help and stumbled upon two pointers two sum (I think that's what its called). In this algorithm, it had used two pointers (left and right) on an already sorted array, decreasing the right pointer when it was larger than the sum, and increasing the left pointer when it was smaller than the sum. Knowing this, I implemented it into my algorithm using the same two pointers method as the second and third integer, and used the a loop for the current first integer. I had to make sure there weren't any duplicates, so I made sure to set parameters all throughout the loop ensuring there were no duplicated before and after each pointer.
