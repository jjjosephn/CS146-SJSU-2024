When trying to figure out an algorithm for this problem, I had to first draw out an example of the problem. Using the intervals example I noticed htat there was a pattern when comparing the intervals. I noticed that whenever there was a new server, the end of a current job would be greater than the start of the next job, and vice versa, when the end of a current job is smaller than the start of the next job, there wouldn't be a new server. However, when there would be intervals out of place, it would ruin how the algorithm fucntioned, so I decided to sort the intervals by the start time of each job. Also, I needed some help figuring out how to sort the intervals by their start time, so I just used the web. One more thing, I initialized the servers to 1 because there would always be one server in the first job.
