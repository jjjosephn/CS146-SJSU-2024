Solving this problem, I used BFS that was recently discussed in one of our lectures. The idea of using BFS in this problem would be:
1. First initialize a queue, a sublist for each level, and a final results list
2. Start with the root
3. Grab the queue length, and loop through the length of the queue
    a. Pop the left most element in the queue
    b. Add the popped element into a sublist for that level
    c. Add the children of that popped element into the queue
4. Add the sublist level to the final results list
5. Repeat steps 3 to 4 until the queue is empty
This was my first time attempting BFS, so I had to search up how to properly implement it
